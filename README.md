# Inventory-manager

Working as an Inventory Controller for a construction company, there were a lot of inaccuracies in the way stock data was  being presented by the various Store Keepers. This pushed me into coding this program using Tkinter and Pandas to enforce a specific data presentation style and easily producing various reports.
